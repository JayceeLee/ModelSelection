# ModelSelection

Model Selection is a data science platform that allows the user to easily run, compare, and save the parameters of six different machine learning algorithms. The program initializes by creating a folder where the user is to put their formatted data with classifications placed in the right most column. Many data sets can be placed here. When run again the program prompts the user to select which dataset they'd like to work with, followed by the summary statistics saved thus far by the program for each model. The user then chooses which machine learning algorithm they'd like to run on the data: K-Nearest Neighbour, Random Forest, RBF SVM, Simple Neural Network, Deep Neural Network, or a Recurrent Neural Network along with a specific model's parameters (such as a value for regularization). KNN, RF, and SVM are performed using SciKit Learn, the Simple Neural Network is hand crafted, and the Deep Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network are run using TensorFlow. After a model has been run summary statistics are reported and the user asked if they'd like to save the current model (as a pickle or checkpoint when using TensorFlow). 

The program can also be used to predict classifications. Upon initialization an alternative folder was created to for files to use a model's saved parameters.
